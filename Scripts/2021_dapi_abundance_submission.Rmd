# Goal

This document shows how **individual bottle** bacterial abundance data from 2021 remineralization experiments were processed, QC'd and analyzed.  

Load packages that we'll need to analyze our data. 
```{r Load packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
```

# Import Data 

```{r}
excel_sheets("~/Documents/144l_students_2021/Input_Data/week4/144L_2021_BactAbund.xlsx")

metadata <- read_excel("~/Documents/144l_students_2021/Input_Data/week4/144L_2021_BactAbund.xlsx", sheet = "Metadata")

glimpse(metadata)

dapi_data <- read_excel("~/Documents/144l_students_2021/Input_Data/week4/144L_2021_BactAbund.xlsx", sheet = "DAPI_Data")
glimpse(dapi_data)

dapi_metadata <- metadata %>%
  select(-Bottle) %>%
  unique()
glimpse(dapi_metadata)

joined <-  left_join(dapi_metadata, dapi_data) 

```

Complete: prepare data, plot growth curves for Cells_L and Cell Biovolume data AND identify exponential growth (same as previous assignment now with the new data). 


# Prepare Data

Convert the Date and Time column values from characters to dates, add columns with time elapsed for each treatment, and convert to cells/L because it will help us match up with the TOC data later. Also drop NA values.

```{r}
#insert your code here
```


# Plot Growth Curves

Plot growth curves for each treatment using DAPI cell abundance and biovolume data. 

## Cell Abundance Growth Curve

```{r}
#insert your code here
```

Q: What differences between the treatments do you observe? Does this make sense in the context of the oxygen drawdown data (pictured below)?

A: 

Oxygen Drawdown:

## Cell Biovolume Growth Curve

```{r}
#insert your code here
```

Q: What differences do you notice between the cell abundance data and the cell biovolume data? 

A:
